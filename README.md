# Chef Mac Packaging Prototype

This repo contains code and notes about creating Mac pkg installers for
the chef-client omnibus package.

I used several hacks to make progress quickly. These are documented in
code comments. The code here will **NOT** work for you out of the box.
This repo is here so I can share my work with the omnibus gurus.
